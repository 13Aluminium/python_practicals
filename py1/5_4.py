# This code defines a Student class with a get_rank method that raises a NotImplementedError, as well as two subclasses Naruto and Sasuke that implement the get_rank method. The get_rank method returns a rank for each student, with a lower rank indicating a higher position.

# In this case, the Naruto class has a get_rank method that returns 1, while the Sasuke class has a get_rank method that returns 2. This means that Naruto will be ranked higher than Sasuke, so Naruto will be displayed as the first student.
